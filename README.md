My Blog
=======

This blog is generated by my own Static Site Generator which can
faster my post publishing by simply adding Markdown format articles
to the archive folder.

Usage
-----

First of all, delete all the files in `content` and all the HTML files
in `site` to start your own publishing, and type `git remote` to check
out and add your remote repository.

```bash
$ git remote
# use `$ git remote add ...` to add your remote repo
```

Second, put your Markdown files in the `content` folder, and run

```bash
$ python publish.py
```

And all the output files will be stored in `site` folder. If you place
some arguments as messages like

```
$ python publish.py -m "updated blog posts"
```

It will generate the pages and automatically commit to your remote
repository with messages.

**Attention!** This generator is only for **User** or **Organization**
Pages sites.
