<p>Ni Hao. My name is <strong>AnqurVanillapy</strong>, a China-based amateur cave
explorer majoring in Software Engineering since 2014. Besides this
full pseudonym, I simply call myself <strong>Anqur</strong>.</p>
<h2>TL; DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>I write Python, C, JavaScript, mostly engaged in Web development.</li>
<li>Still in college, 20 year-old sophomore in Jinan University.</li>
<li><strong>Haikou</strong>, Hainan is my hometown. Now in <strong>Zhuhai</strong>, Guangdong I
receive a universtiy education.</li>
<li>Things I'm interested in:</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why ANQUR?</h2>
<p><strong>Anqur</strong> means <em>enjoyment</em> (<em>安趣<sup>儿</sup></em>) in Chinese, a brief
statement of a paragraph accidently taken from my high school textbook
of language class. The character <em>安</em> (<em>ān</em>) can also be explained
<em>where</em> in Classical Chinese (文言文) as an interrogative pronoun. So
further I expended these to a phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>安于生趣，然趣之安在？<br/>
Enjoy my life, but where is the joy?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why VANILLAPY?</h2>
<p>Since November 2014, I participated in an educational five-week
campaign of programming,
<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/kcpycamp/">PythoniCamp</a>, hosted by
engineer <a href="http://zoomquiet.io/">Zoom.Quiet</a> from
<a href="http://blog.zhgdg.org/">GDG Zhuhai</a>, learning the basics of
<strong>Python</strong> and making some challenges of creating CLI applications. I
started to use <strong>Python</strong> as my first tool to further explore the
computational universe.</p>
<p>Imitating the project name of <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>, I
combined my favorite flavor of Coca-Cola, <strong>Vanilla</strong>, with the suffix
<strong>-py</strong>, eventually <strong>Vanillapy</strong>, as part of my pseudonym for
identifying myself a programmer.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Vanilla</em> is also the reference to:<ul>
<li><em>VanillaJS</em>, the most powerful JavaScript library in the world.</li>
<li><em>Vanilla DOOM</em>, the original executable version of FPS game
<em>DOOM</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, <em>Vanilla is the power</em>.</p>
<h2>Early Years</h2>
<p>I spent my teenage mainly in music, games and was quite obssessed with
the magic of the Internet. Before my entering college, I produced four
or five music compilations with illegal copy of <em>FL Studio 9</em>,
uploaded them on some domestic cloud storage websites and shared them
with my friends. At that time I usually used an alias called
<strong>MCxMike</strong> to establish my online reputation, although this alter-ego
was eventually a failure and deprecated.</p>
<p>During my early internet surfing, I picked up some web design skills
in junior high school classes, where I was taught to use <em>FrontPage</em>
(illegal copy, a common phenomenon in Chinese education) to create
simple web views, using <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element tags for layout. Apart from
schooling, on my cousin's Lenovo PC with the infamous operating system
<em>Windows Vista</em>, I found a built-in educational program for learning
basics of HTML and made a simple web page with <em>Notepad</em> as my music
player. With these skills, I got a <code>.tk</code> domain name for free and
hosted a static website for my thoughts and music projects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, game modding was also my fountain of exploration. Before
senior high school, I was an FPS buff who could not let go any Valve's
releases, especially the Half-Life series. During my hanging out on
website ModDB, I started to learn about the engines that drove my
favorite and mind-bending games, with SDKs of <em>GoldSrc</em> and <em>Source</em>
as my initial attempt. Nonetheless, I just created a very basic map
for Counter-Strike and was messed up with the thousands of slots of
C++ codes behind <em>Source</em>. Fortunately, I drew up some plots and
storylines of my own FPS game in dreams, attempting to realize them in
the days I have a better command of programming. Teenager passions,
whatever.</p>
<h2>Why HORRIBLE RAM?</h2>
<p><em>Horrible</em> can be similarly read as <em>Orobl</em>, and the confusing word
<strong>oroblram</strong> (namely <em>Orobl RAM</em>) is just the palindrome of the famous
cigarette brand, <strong>Marlboro</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, it's a slight refernce to the David Fincher's film,
<em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, which illustrates an unique hacker
ethic that attracts me much. In the film, main character Mikael
Blomkvist buys a <strong>Marlboro Red</strong> after he losing a libel case.</p>
