title:      Who Am I, Actually?

Ni Hao. My name is **AnqurVanillapy**, a China-based amateur cave
explorer majoring in Software Engineering since 2014. Besides this
full pseudonym, I simply call myself **Anqur**.

## TL; DR

- I write Python, C, JavaScript, mostly engaged in Web development.
- In love with programmer pragmatism and internet subgenres of
aesthetics.
- A 20 year-old sophomore in Jinan University.
- **Haikou**, Hainan is my hometown. Now in **Zhuhai**, Guangdong I
receive my universtiy education.
- Things I'm interested in (but not actually good at):
    + Web development
    + Interpreter and parsing
    + Computer graphics
    + Game development
    + Emulator programming
    + System architecture
    + Functional programming

## Why ANQUR?

**Anqur** means *enjoyment* (*安趣<sup>儿</sup>*) in Chinese, a brief
statement of a paragraph accidently taken from my high school textbook
of language class. The character *安* (*ān*) can also be explained
*where* in Classical Chinese (文言文) as an interrogative pronoun. So
further I expended these to a phrase:

> 安于生趣，然趣之安在？  
> Enjoy my life, but where is the joy?

## Why VANILLAPY?

Since November 2014, I participated in an educational five-week
campaign of programming, known as
[PythoniCamp](https://code.google.com/archive/p/kcpycamp/), hosted by
engineer [Zoom.Quiet](http://zoomquiet.io/) from
[GDG Zhuhai](http://blog.zhgdg.org/), for learning the basics of
Python and making some challenges of creating CLI applications
<sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup>. I started to use **Python** as my first tool
to further explore the computational universe.

Imitating the project name of [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/), I
combined my favorite flavor of Coca-Cola, **Vanilla**, with the suffix
**-py**, eventually **Vanillapy**, as part of my pseudonym for
identifying myself a programmer.

- *Vanilla* is also the reference to:
    + *VanillaJS*, the most powerful JavaScript library in the world.
    + *Vanilla DOOM*, the original executable version of FPS game
    *DOOM*.

So yes, *Vanilla is the power*.

## Slogan

> Time is running out. Make a move.

This slogan is a line of lyrics of *It's Your Move* by famous American
soul singer **Diana Ross**, which is in her album *Swept Away*. But
actually, I got it from the *Vaporwave* subgenre pioneer
**MACINTOSH PLUS**, whose track *リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー* sampled
the brainchild of *Diana Ross* and became the brand new icon of the
internet subcultures. And that's why I chose a blue-liquid-headed
Michelangelo's David image from Tumblr as my commonly used avatar,
tributing to this trend of memes and subgenres.

Life is so short and time is just running out. We the most of human
beings are just trying to be a time hacker. So make a move right away.
Try to make your life beautiful and meaningful. But hey, memers, you
know that, romance is just a **vaporware** like the character of
*City Pop* in Japanese society. Just feel the *ass dead dicks* of life
<sup>[[2]](#ref2)</sup>.

## Early years

I spent my teenage mainly in music, games and was quite obssessed with
the magic of the Internet. Before my entering college, I produced four
or five music compilations with illegal copy of *FL Studio 9*,
uploaded them on some domestic cloud storage websites and shared them
with my friends. At that time I usually used an alias called
**MCxMike** to establish my online reputation, although this alter-ego
was eventually a failure and deprecated.

During my early internet surfing, I picked up some web design skills
in junior high school classes, where I was taught to use *FrontPage*
(illegal copy, a common phenomenon in Chinese education) to create
simple web views, using `<table>` element tags for layout. Apart from
schooling, on my cousin's Lenovo PC with the infamous operating system
*Windows Vista*, I found a built-in educational program for learning
basics of HTML and made a simple web page with *Notepad* as my music
player. With these skills, I got a `.tk` domain name for free and
hosted a static website for my thoughts and music projects.

Furthermore, game modding was also my fountain of exploration. Before
senior high school, I was an FPS buff who could not let go any Valve's
releases, especially the Half-Life series. During my hanging out on
website ModDB, I started to learn about the engines that drove my
favorite and mind-bending games, with SDKs of *GoldSrc* and *Source*
as my initial attempt. Nonetheless, I just created a very basic map
on Counter-Strike and was messed up with the thousands of slots of C++
codes behind *Source*. Fortunately, I drew up some plots and
storylines of my own FPS game in dreams, attempting to realize them in
the days I have a better command of programming. Teenager passions,
whatever.

## Why HORRIBLE RAM?

*Horrible* can be similarly read as *Orobl*, and the confusing word
**Orobl RAM** (namely *oroblram*) is just the palindrome of the famous
cigarette brand, **Marlboro**.

Also, it's a slight refernce to the David Fincher's film,
*The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*, which illustrates an unique hacker
ethic that attracts me much. In the film, main character Mikael
Blomkvist buys a **Marlboro Red** after he losing a libel case.
