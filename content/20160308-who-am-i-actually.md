# WHO AM I, ACTUALLY? #

![avatar](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9910794?v=3&s=460)

Ni Hao. My name is **AnqurVanillapy**, a China-based amateur cave
explorer majoring in Software Engineering since 2014. Besides this
full pseudonym, I simply call myself **Anqur**.

## TL; DR ##

- I write Python, C, JavaScript, mostly engaged in Web development.
- Still in college, 20 year-old sophomore in Jinan University.
- **Haikou**, Hainan is my hometown. Now in **Zhuhai**, Guangdong I
receive a universtiy education.
- Things I'm interested in:

## Why ANQUR? ##

**Anqur** means *enjoyment* (*安趣<sup>儿</sup>*) in Chinese, a brief
statement of a paragraph accidently taken from my high school textbook
of language class. The character *安* (*ān*) can also be explained
*where* in Classical Chinese (文言文) as an interrogative pronoun. So
further I expended these to a phrase:

> 安于生趣，然趣之安在？  
> Enjoy my life, but where is the joy?

## Why VANILLAPY? ##

Since November 2014, I participated in an educational five-week
campaign of programming,
[PythoniCamp](https://code.google.com/archive/p/kcpycamp/), hosted by
engineer [Zoom.Quiet](http://zoomquiet.io/) from
[GDG Zhuhai](http://blog.zhgdg.org/), learning the basics of
**Python** and making some challenges of creating CLI applications. I
started to use **Python** as my first tool to further explore the
computational universe.

Imitating the project name of [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/), I
combined my favorite flavor of Coca-Cola, **Vanilla**, with the suffix
**-py**, eventually **Vanillapy**, as part of my pseudonym for
identifying myself a programmer.

- *Vanilla* is also the reference to:
    + *VanillaJS*, the most powerful JavaScript library in the world.
    + *Vanilla DOOM*, the original executable version of FPS game
    *DOOM*.

So yes, *Vanilla is the power*.

## Early Years ##

I spent my teenage mainly in music, games and was quite obssessed with
the magic of the Internet. Before my entering college, I produced four
or five music compilations with illegal copy of *FL Studio 9*,
uploaded them on some domestic cloud storage websites and shared them
with my friends. At that time I usually used an alias called
**MCxMike** to establish my online reputation, although this alter-ego
was eventually a failure and deprecated.

During my early internet surfing, I picked up some web design skills
in junior high school classes, where I was taught to use *FrontPage*
(illegal copy, a common phenomenon in Chinese education) to create
simple web views, using `<table>` element tags for layout. Apart from
schooling, on my cousin's Lenovo PC with the infamous operating system
*Windows Vista*, I found a built-in educational program for learning
basics of HTML and made a simple web page with *Notepad* as my music
player. With these skills, I got a `.tk` domain name for free and
hosted a static website for my thoughts and music projects.

Furthermore, game modding was also my fountain of exploration. Before
senior high school, I was an FPS buff who could not let go any Valve's
releases, especially the Half-Life series. During my hanging out on
website ModDB, I started to learn about the engines that drove my
favorite and mind-bending games, with SDKs of *GoldSrc* and *Source*
as my initial attempt. Nonetheless, I just created a very basic map
for Counter-Strike and was messed up with the thousands of slots of
C++ codes behind *Source*. Fortunately, I drew up some plots and
storylines of my own FPS game in dreams, attempting to realize them in
the days I have a better command of programming. Teenager passions,
whatever.

## Why HORRIBLE RAM? ##

*Horrible* can be similarly read as *Orobl*, and the confusing word
**oroblram** (namely *Orobl RAM*) is just the palindrome of the famous
cigarette brand, **Marlboro**.

Also, it's a slight refernce to the David Fincher's film,
*The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*, which illustrates an unique hacker
ethic that attracts me much. In the film, main character Mikael
Blomkvist buys a **Marlboro Red** after he losing a libel case.
